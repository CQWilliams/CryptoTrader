# CryptoTrader
This is a simple mock up crypto currency trader that makes use of an API to track current prices written by myself 
and my classmate Christa Fraley. 

If you wish to download and test this yourself you'll need the Newtonsoft.json NuGet package.

Currently we have plans to convert this into a mobile app that can be used to track current prices of cryptocurrencies!
