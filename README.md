# CryptoTrader
This is a simple mock up crypto currency trader that makes use of an API to track current prices written by myself 
and my classmate Christa Fraley. 

If you wish to download and test this yourself you'll need the Newtonsoft.json NuGet package.

Currently we have plans to convert this into a mobile app that can be used to track current prices of cryptocurrencies!


# Original Prompt
o Build an application that allows a user to trade crypto currencies. The application should:
- Allow a user to start with a $5000 hard-coded balance
- Trade their account balance for Bitcoin, Etherium, and Litecoin at the following values:
  * Bitcoin: 3391.28
  * Etherium: 89.60
  * Litecoin: 23.90
- Trade their crypto currencies for cash value.
- Trade crypto currencies for each other
- Have menu options to purchase, sell, trade and view balances

# Future Plans
Christa and I are currently working on creating an application that will allow users to check the prices of any cryptocurrency in comparison to any standard currency. We intend to make this available on desktop, Android, and iOS.
